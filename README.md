## ðŸ“– Project Description

This project is a web-based platform developed for the **P2 Project** in **Computer Science** at **Aalborg University**. The aim is to address the fragmentation of digital platforms used by students for both social and academic purposes. Currently, students use multiple platforms to manage their social interactions, work-related tasks, and study materials. This platform strives to integrate these functionalities into one cohesive solution, simplifying the management of online presence in a unified space.

The platform is still in development and aims to offer a comprehensive space where students can connect, collaborate, and organize their academic and social lives all in one place.

## ðŸš€ Features We Hope to Integrate

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Aiming for a seamless user experience by dynamically loading content based on user actions (e.g., home page, profile, feed).
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure login and signup functionality, with the option to delete accounts.
- **User Profiles**: Enabling users to create and manage their profiles, customize their information, and view other users' profiles.
